# 🚀 Marketplace Hackathon - Day 3: API Integration and Data Migration

## 📋 Objective
The focus of Day 3 is to integrate APIs and migrate data into **Sanity CMS**, building a scalable and functional backend for your marketplace. This step bridges the gap between data and functionality, ensuring seamless frontend integration.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights
- **API Integration:** Fetch and display data from APIs in your **Next.js** project.  
- **Data Migration:** Populate **Sanity CMS** with product, category, and order data.  
- **Schema Validation:** Align **Sanity CMS** schemas with API structures for consistency.  
- **End-to-End Flow:** Demonstrate a complete data pipeline, from backend to frontend.

---

## 🛠️ Features Implemented
1. **API Integration in Next.js**  
   - Utilize Axios to fetch product and category data from the provided APIs.
   - Render dynamic data on key pages (e.g., Product Listings, Details, Categories).
   - Test endpoints using tools like Postman.

2. **Sanity CMS as Backend**  
   - Store and manage product, order, and customer data.  
   - Adjust schemas to align with API fields, ensuring compatibility.  

3. **Data Migration**  
   - Scripts written to fetch, transform, and upload data to **Sanity CMS**.  
   - Support for manual imports using JSON or CSV files.

4. **Error Handling and Validation**  
   - Centralized error logging for API failures.  
   - Fallback data for smoother user experiences during errors.
