       [Frontend (Next.js)] ‚Üî [Sanity CMS] ‚Üî [Third-Party APIs (e.g., Payment Gateway, Shipment Tracking)]
       ```
  3. **Plan API Requirements:**  
     - Define endpoints for product listings, order placements, and shipment tracking.  
  4. **Technical Documentation:**  
     - Document system architecture, workflows, and schema adjustments.  
- **Outcome:** A comprehensive technical plan ready for implementation.

### **Day 3: API Integration and Data Migration**
- **Objective:** Integrate APIs and migrate data into **Sanity CMS**.  
- **Key Activities:**
  - Validate schemas and align them with API structures.  
  - Write migration scripts to fetch and populate data in **Sanity CMS**.  
  - Integrate APIs into the **Next.js** frontend:
